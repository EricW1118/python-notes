    "##### Updating a package within a project can introduce compatibility issues with other packages that rely on it. Additionally, upgrading may lead to dependency conflicts, potentially breaking dependent packages that utilize code from the updated package. Virtual environments can help us solve these problems.\n",
    "There are several virtual environment for Python projects, there are listed as following:\n",
    "1. Virtualenv\n",
    "2. Conda\n",
    "3. Pipenv\n",
    "4. venv\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the tools above, the most commonly used are Conda, Pipenv, and venv. Specifically, Conda finds favor among Data Scientists, while Pipenv is preferred by software engineers. Conda serves both as a package manager and a virtual environment, offering the added advantage of enabling users to control the Python version within the virtual environment, thus ensuring compatibility with the project. Given its convenience, Conda is my tool of choice for managing projects."
